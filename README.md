This website leverages GPT-3.5 along with a database of user-generated queries to adequately generate new predictions.
It is structured in such a way the queries and responses scale with time and user-generated content.

A serverside snapshot of the website has been published in this github repo for those interested in seeing the inner workings of this proyect or developing something similar.

Hope this helps!
